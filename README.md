# monster-hunter-damage-calculator-prototype
A C++ calculator I was building for personal use for the Monster Hunter game series. Allows the user to calculate the damage they inflict based on inputted weapon stats, attack values, and monster defense values. Currently a prototype version made for practicing what I learned from my classes. Will likely remake the project in the future.
